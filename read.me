I decided to design my buttons with pastel colours so they arent 
too bright. I decided to add colors and expand the buttons as you hover over them.
I really wanted to add transitions to the colors but unfortunately i struggled with that
therefore I instead made them expand. I am particularly proud of being able
to add spaces between the letters as you expand the buttons.
